    "## Overview\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). OOP allows for organizing complex programs into manageable, modular components, making your code more reusable, scalable, and easier to maintain.\n",

    "- Defining classes and creating objects\n",
    "- Attributes and methods\n",
    "- Inheritance and polymorphism\n",

    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.\n",

    "An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, you are creating an instance of a class with specific values for its attributes.\n",
