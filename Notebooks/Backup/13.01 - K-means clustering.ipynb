    "# Introduction to KMeans Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is KMeans Clustering?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **KMeans** is an **unsupervised learning algorithm** used for **clustering** data.\n",
    "- The goal of KMeans is to partition data into **K distinct clusters** based on similarities.\n",
    "- Each data point is assigned to the **nearest cluster** (based on distance to the centroid).\n",
    "- The algorithm tries to minimize the **inertia** (sum of squared distances between points and their nearest cluster center).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. How Does KMeans Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The KMeans algorithm operates in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: \n",
    "   - Choose `K` initial centroids randomly or using smarter methods (e.g., k-means++).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Assignment Step**: \n",
    "   - Assign each data point to the nearest cluster centroid based on Euclidean distance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Update Step**:\n",
    "   - Recalculate the centroids by finding the mean of all points assigned to each cluster.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Repeat**:\n",
    "   - Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centroids no longer change significantly (convergence).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output**:\n",
    "   - Final centroids and cluster assignments for each point.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Centroids**: The center of a cluster; each point in a cluster is closest to its centroid.\n",
    "- **Cluster**: A group of data points that are similar to each other and closer to their own centroid than to any other centroid.\n",
    "- **Inertia**: The sum of squared distances between points and their assigned cluster centroids. The algorithm tries to minimize this.\n",
    "  \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Important Parameters in KMeans\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n_clusters`: Number of clusters to form.\n",
    "- `random_state`: Ensures reproducibility by fixing the random initialization of centroids.\n",
    "- `max_iter`: The maximum number of iterations to run the algorithm.\n",
    "- `init`: The method for initializing centroids (e.g., 'random', 'k-means++').\n",
    "- `tol`: The tolerance to declare convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Example Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create and configure KMeans model\n",
    "model = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the model to data (assuming X is the dataset)\n",
    "model.fit(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access cluster labels and centroids\n",
    "labels = model.labels_\n",
    "centroids = model.cluster_centers_\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Choosing the Right Number of Clusters (K)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selecting the optimal number of clusters is crucial for meaningful results.\n",
    "- Common techniques to determine `K`:\n",
    "  - **Elbow Method**: Plot the inertia for different values of `K` and look for an \"elbow\" where the decrease in inertia slows down.\n",
    "  - **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar a point is to its cluster compared to other clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Applications of KMeans Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Segmentation**: Group customers by purchasing behavior or demographics.\n",
    "- **Image Compression**: Reduce the number of colors in an image by clustering similar colors.\n",
    "- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify outliers as points that do not belong to any major cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Limitations of KMeans\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sensitive to the choice of `K` (number of clusters).\n",
    "- Assumes clusters are **spherical** and equally sized, which may not be true in all datasets.\n",
    "- May get stuck in local minima due to random initialization (can be mitigated by running the algorithm multiple times with different initializations).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **KMeans** is a powerful yet simple algorithm for partitioning data into clusters.\n",
    "- It works by iteratively assigning points to clusters and updating centroids to minimize within-cluster variance.\n",
    "- Careful tuning of parameters like `K` and proper data preprocessing are essential for effective clustering.\n",
