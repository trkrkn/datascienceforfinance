    "- **Next Steps:**\n",
    "  - Continue practicing file I/O and CSV operations using real-world datasets.\n",
    "  - Learn more about data analysis with `pandas` in the next lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This updated lecture outline introduces students to input/output operations, focusing on how to work with CSV files both using basic Python functions and the `pandas` library. The added sections on CSV handling and `pandas` are particularly relevant for data science and finance students, where data often comes in CSV format."

    "# Add a new column 'Value'\n",
    "df['Value'] = df['Price'] * df['Volume']\n",
    "print(df.head())\n",

    "# Group by 'Stock' and calculate the average price\n",
    "avg_price_per_stock = df.groupby('Stock')['Price'].mean()\n",

    "- Save the manipulated DataFrame to a new CSV file.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Save the modified DataFrame to a new CSV file\n",

    "By the end of this exercise, you will have:\n",
    "- Loaded the `stock_data.csv` file.\n",
    "- Filtered, calculated, and grouped data using `pandas`.\n",
    "- Saved the modified data to a new CSV file called `modified_stock_data.csv`.\n",
