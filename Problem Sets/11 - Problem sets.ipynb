    "## 1. Exploring Data Import and Summary Statistics\n",
    "Using a dataset of your choice, import it and display its summary statistics, focusing on the range, mean, and standard deviation of each variable. Then, use `.describe()` to validate your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Plotting High-Frequency Data\n",
    "Download a dataset with high-frequency financial data (e.g., minute-by-minute or tick data for a stock). Create a time series plot of the data, focusing on a specific trading day. Discuss any patterns or anomalies that you observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Calculating Daily Returns\n",
    "For each stock in a dataset of end-of-day prices, calculate the daily absolute and percentage changes. Identify which stock shows the highest daily return and which shows the lowest, then plot these daily returns to analyze volatility over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Exploring Logarithmic Returns and Cumulative Returns\n",
    "Using a single stock from your dataset, calculate the daily logarithmic returns. Then, compute cumulative returns by summing these log returns and apply the exponential function to the cumulative sum. Plot both the daily and cumulative returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Applying Rolling Statistics\n",
    "Select a financial time series (e.g., stock prices or exchange rates). Apply a 30-day rolling window to calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation. Plot these rolling statistics along with the original time series to observe how they capture short-term trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) Analysis\n",
    "Calculate the 20-day exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of a financial time series. Experiment with different `halflife` values (e.g., 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0) and compare the results. Explain how changes in `halflife` affect the responsiveness of the EWMA to recent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Correlation Between Two Stocks\n",
    "Choose two stocks that are known to have a strong correlation (positive or negative). Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and create a scatter plot of their daily returns. Overlay the best-fit line using linear regression. Comment on the relationship you observe.\n",

    "## 10. Analyzing SMA Crossovers for Trading Strategy\n",
    "Using a financial time series, calculate two simple moving averages (SMAs), one with a 30-day window and the other with a 100-day window. Plot both SMAs along with the original time series, and identify the points where the short-term SMA crosses the long-term SMA. Develop a basic trading strategy based on these crossover points and calculate the theoretical returns from the strategy.\n",

    "## 1. Advanced Data Import and Analysis\n",
    "Using a dataset with financial time series data, write a function to dynamically load, clean, and standardize the data (i.e., scale each series to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1). Additionally, identify any outliers using a robust method like the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, and visualize the standardized series with outliers marked. Discuss how outliers affect the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Multi-Frequency Aggregation Analysis\n",
    "Choose a high-frequency dataset (e.g., tick or minute-level data) and resample it into multiple frequencies: 5-minute, 30-minute, and daily intervals. For each frequency, apply aggregation functions (mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation). Compare the results, discussing how different time intervals affect the summary statistics and what insights can be gained from this multi-frequency analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 6. Dynamic Correlation Analysis\n",
    "Choose two correlated financial time series (e.g., a stock index and its volatility index) and calculate the rolling 252-day correlation. Then, segment the data into two periods (e.g., a period of low volatility and a period of high volatility) and calculate the average correlation during each period. Use these findings to hypothesize about how correlations between assets might change during different market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. High-Frequency Data Resampling and Market Impact Analysis\n",
    "Using high-frequency tick data, resample it to both minute-level and 10-minute-level intervals.

    "## 8. Multiple Exponential Moving Averages and Trend Analysis\n",
    "For a chosen stock or index, compute multiple exponential moving averages (EMAs) with different spans (e.g., 10-day, 30-day, 90-day) and overlay them on the original time series. Identify crossover points between shorter and longer EMAs, then analyze the time between crossovers and their connection to major trends. Create a function to dynamically flag crossovers and discuss how these signals could be used in a trading strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Rolling Window PCA for Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "Use a dataset with multiple time series (e.g., prices of different stocks in a sector). Implement a rolling 60-day Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the data to its first two principal components. Visualize the time series data projected onto these components and explain any observable patterns or clusters. Discuss how dimensionality reduction could assist in understanding sector-wide trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Volatility Estimation and Forecasting\n",
    "For a single time series (e.g., daily returns), estimate its historical volatility using a 252-day rolling standard deviation. Then, use a GARCH(1,1) model to forecast future volatility based on recent data. Compare the GARCH model’s forecast with the rolling standard deviation and explain situations where one might be more effective than the other for volatility estimation.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Solution 5\n",
    "Apply `.ewm()` with halflife set to 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 for variance. Lower halflife values increase responsiveness to new data points, showing more frequent spikes in risk estimation for fast-moving time series.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Solution 7\n",
    "Calculate mid-price and percentage change for minute and 10-minute intervals using `.resample()` and `.pct_change()`. Identify high-change intervals and check against volume data to assess possible causes like order imbalance or news events.\n",
